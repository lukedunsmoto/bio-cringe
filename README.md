# BioCringe

**The Ultimate Cringe Bio Generator**  

Ever wanted a bio that screams "I’m quirky, but in the worst possible way"? **BioCringe** is here to generate the most gloriously embarrassing bios for you. Whether you're looking for LinkedIn nightmares, dating app disasters, or social media cringe gold, this generator has you covered.

## Features

- Generates bios that range from *mildly awkward* to *full-blown secondhand embarrassment*
- Built-in phrases like *"CEO of Vibes"*, *"Aspiring Astronaut. Currently on Earth."*, and other gems
- Works out of the box – no setup stress

## Installation

BioCringe is a simple index.html file (with optional 404.html and robots.txt, as well as static image assets). Use all, use none, remix to your liking.

## Example Output

```
- Booked a WeWork desk, now just need a company 💼✨
- Founder of an empire (just need a product) 🚀💰
- I don't have passive income yet, but my confidence is compounding 📈💡
```
